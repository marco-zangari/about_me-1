# about_me
created to hold the about_me project that will be used for the first week of class

This webpage holds some information about myself. It contains five questions and answers, all yes or no, that will help the reader to get a better feel for who I am. Right now it is quite simple and informal but in the future it could serve as a nice portfolio to display some of my work as a programmer.

It is styled using a css stylesheet, which gives the page some nice color and a few different fonts to make it stand out more than a simple webpage. My knowledge of CSS is still limited but as it expands so too will the beauty of this page.

It also has some javascript running to ask the questions to the reader and see if they can guess a few things about me. The script first creates several variables to store the questions being asked and a response to give the user when they answer correctly or incorrectly. After this it asks them a question and prompts them for an answer, then it checks if the answer is correct or not and displays a corresponding message. It checks whether the answer is correct or not by first converting it to all caps and then checking the equivalency of the answer to either Y or YES (or N or NO).
